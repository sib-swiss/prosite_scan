This directory contains PERL scripts for PROSITE searching and related stuff.

At the moment, the following files are available:

prosite_convert    : Converts the PROSITE.DAT file of the PROSITE release
                     into a file containing regular expressions. This file
		     is needed for prosite_scan.
		 
prosite_scan       : Takes the regular-expression file (as created by 
                     prosite_convert) and scans a sequence (or a group of 
		     sequences) with all patterns contained in the file.
		     Output either in ASCII or HTML format.
		
dbshuffle          : Performs random shuffling of a database, a window size
                     for regional shuffling can be specified. Input and output
		     databases have to be in FASTA format.

shuffle            : Performs random shuffling of a single sequence, a window 
                     size for regional shuffling can be specified. It is 
                     possible to create a 'database' containing several 
		     shuffled sequences made from one input sequence. 

prosite_statistics : Runs all patterns of a prosite file (in regular expression
	             format, see prosite_convert) against shuffled version of
		     a database (see dbshuffle) and counts number of 
		     occurrences. Some basic statistics is also calculated.
		 
pst_stat.txt
pst_stat.html
pst_stat.table.html: The prosite_statistics output of a current release of 
                     PROSITE agains a current release of SwissProt in three
		     different formats. The .table.html format is only for
		     HTML viewers that support tables.
           
pattern_find       : Searches a FASTA-formatted sequence database with
                     a regular expression (in PERL style or in PROSITE
		     format)
